I am a Ph.D. student (2017-2022) in Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and also a member of the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP). I am fortunately advised by [Kevin Duh](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~kevinduh/).

Before joining JHU-CLSP, I was a research engineer at Baidu-I2R Research Center (BIRC), Singapore, and did research in Relation Extraction and Sentiment Analysis with [Jian Su](https://colips.org/~sujian/).
Prior to that, I obtained a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of California, Berkeley.

My research interests focus in natural language processing, particularly in cross-lingual information retrieval and quality estimation for machine translation.
